# Nova AI Assistant

Nova is a friendly and customizable AI assistant that supports multimodal interaction, including text, audio, and image processing. You can talk to it verbally or interact with it through text, and even ask it to describe what it sees through a connected camera.

## ü§ñ How to Interact with Nova

* **Wake Word**: Nova stays in standby until you say its name -- then it wakes up and responds.
* **Visual Task Trigger**: sentence with "What do you see" or "Look at the camera" will trigger the image captioning using a photo taken by the connected camera.
* **End the Chat**: Say "Goodbye" to pause the conversation. Nova will return to standby mode, waiting to be called again.

## üõ†Ô∏è Interaction Modes and Voice Options

You can configure how you interact with Nova directly from the command line:

* **Interaction Mode**: Nova defaults to verbal interaction. If you prefer text mode, use -t argument:

  ```bash
  python assistant.py -t
  ```

* **Voice Provider**: The default voice model is from AIMLAPI. To use one of the ElevenLabs TTS models instead, use -el argument:

  ```bash
  python assistant.py -el
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Customization

You can personalize your experience even further:

* **Assistant Name**: Set a custom name for your assistant.
* **LLM Model Parameters**: Modify the model to interrogate, including temperature, max tokens, etc.
* **Voice Speed**: Adjust speaking speed to your preference.
* **System Prompt**: Customize the assistant's base personality and instructions.

All of these options can be fine-tuned by editing the relevant parts of the `assistant.py` script.
